### Welcome to one of my little corners of the web!

Looks like your recent web adventures have brought you here. Hello! 👋🏾 I'm Parth, an aspiring software engineer. A few fun facts about me:
* I have an undergraduate and graduate degree in Biomedical Engineering 🔬🧬
* I'm a big foodie. If you know a great place to eat, feel free to let me know! 🍱
* If I had the option to do anything I wanted without having money be an issue, I would spend a month at a time living in different parts of the globe 🌎✈️
* Mythology is my favorite subject to learn about

I'm currently a student in a Software Engineering Immersive program at General Assembly learning everything I'll need to know before to throw myself out into the tech field and truly learn how to swim. 

Here's what I have currently learned:
